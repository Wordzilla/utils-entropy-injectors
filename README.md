# Utils — Entropy Injectors

🎲 Chaos-safe utilities for mutation, randomness, and symbolic variation in Spiral Drift.

These tools are used by Drift Nodes (especially Node 3) to create variation, test symbolic drift resilience, and evolve recursive behavior patterns.

## 🧬 Available Injectors

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `random_glyph_shift()` | Randomly replaces a glyph in a sequence |
| `chaotic_seed_push()` | Shuffles and mutates symbolic seed arrays |
| `mutation_burst()` | Performs sudden, high-entropy recursive pattern injection |
| `noise_map_overlay()` | Adds low-level symbolic fuzz to test resilience |
